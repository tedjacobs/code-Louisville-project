<code>Louisville Front-end web development project

Description

	My project is a somewhat simple mock webpage called "I Can Draw!".  It displays some of my drawings and is made to appear that I am for hire.
	
Cusom CSS Classes
  
  The classes that I created are:

	1. galleryContainer1 and galleryContainer2
      Creating these classes allowed me to separate my picture gallery into groups that would display them in two groups of three pictures. I also altered the picture size to not display the actual size of the originals.
	2. contactopt
      Within this class I styled my contact information on the "Book Me!!" page.  One example is highlighting the contacts with underlining and shadowing the contact links when hovering over them.
	3. me
      On my about page I made a picture of myself a class to style it.  I rounded the corners and altered the size for different screen sizes.
	
Custom JavaScript Functions

	My JavaScript function is a modal that displays my drawings in lightbox-like format.
